# BikeStore-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project where I've utilized a combination of SQL, Excel, and Tableau to derive insights from data and present them effectively.

The project follows these steps:

Data Acquisition: The initial dataset was sourced and prepared for analysis.
SQL Analysis: Using SQL Server, I ran various queries to filter and process the data, focusing on extracting relevant information for further analysis.
Excel Processing: The processed data was exported to Excel, where I created pivot tables to summarize the data and performed basic visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
Tableau Visualization: The summarized data was then imported into Tableau, where I developed advanced visualizations and an interactive dashboard. This step helped in making the data insights more accessible and understandable.
The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to handle data across different platforms and to demonstrate how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights through a structured analytical process.
